# Overview
In this project, I tried to create a 2D game using mlx library installed in the school computer.
# Timeline
It took me altogether 2 weeks to finish this project which is soooooo long.

_0715-0718 Starting the program with map parsing_

_0721-0723 Learning about the fundamentals of window management and rendering, finishing the 1st draft of mandatory part_

_0724 Fixing all the problems of memory leak_

_0725 Starting the bonus part(enemy, display of moves, animation) but stuck by flashing problem_

_0728 Rewriting my rendering part and fixing all the bugs_

_0729 Get evaluated and passed with 123(one of my evaluators deducted 2 points because of the simplicity of my realization of bonus part)_
# The satisfactory parts of my project
-My map parsing part is complete and the error handling is explicit

I had a lot of maps created, valid/invalid, small/medium/large...

The exit is clean and error messages are clear

-I love the theme I chose. It is pretty cute, isn't it?

A little pig's adventure: It has to collect all the coins and then jumps into the swimming pool before caught by the BUG.

Also I did a lot of work to make the textures coherent, e.g. change the size, modify the background.

Here I would recommend several useful websites for editing pics:

# What I want to do but give up eventually

-I only created one enemy in the bonus part, which can be extended further

-I want to make this program running not only on the school computer but also my macbook, but failed to do this due to lack of time

-I would write my struct in a more orderly and organized way

(But I will try to do better in the future projects definitely)
